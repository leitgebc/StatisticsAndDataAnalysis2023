# Quickstart Jupyter Notebooks

A Jupyter notebook is a very handy and convenient IPython interface. It works line based so you can execute it line by line and you will see the output of your code directly below it.
If you have installed jupyter and jupyter notbook in your environment, you can just get started by typing
```
jupyter-lab
```
or
```
jupyter-notebook
```
in your command line.

Usually, a window in your browser will be opened and show you a contents page of the directory you opened Jupyter in. You can then open a specific Jupyter notebook by clicking on a file with the ending ''.ipynb''.
Inside a notebook you can work through the notebook by executing one line of code after the other, by clicking on the respective line and either clicking on the ''play'' button on the top of the notebook or by pressing <shift+enter> on your keyboard.

If you are creating your own notebook, you can simply do so by selecting ``<File> --> <New> --> <Notebook>`` in the uppermost menu bar. You'll then be asked to select a kernel for running your code, e.g. Python 3. A new document will then appear with the first line already created for you to fill. You can create as many lines as you want by either using the ''+'' symbol in the upper right corner or just adding a line above or below the existing one using the buttons on the right of your active line.
When creating a line you have the options of making it a markdown cell (for displaying text), a code cell (for programming, which can be executed) and a raw cell (just whatever you type in it). You can select those options on the top of your notebook.

If you are having troubles of lines not compiling anymore (that previously have), it might help to run all the code cells again one after another. In ordner not to execute all cells by hand, you can just use one of the options in the ``<Run>`` tab in the menu bar on the top of the page. You can also restart the kernel if necessary (sometimes needed if you have made some updates to your environment) and rerun all your code cells by using the options in the ``<Kernel>`` tab in the menu bar.
